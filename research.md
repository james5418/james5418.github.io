## Mobile and Ubiquitous Interaction Lab

During my junior and senior years, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in Professor [Yung-Ju Chang's](https://www.armuro.info) Mobile and Ubiquitous Interaction Lab, focusing on mobile attention and notification. Herein, I accumulated substantial research experience in human-computer interaction and contributed to multiple projects. My research primarily centered around mobile notification summarization and the related challenges in combination with generative AI. This led to the development of [NotiSummary](https://github.com/noti-summary/NotiSummary), an app that employs large language models to present mobile notifications in a concise summary form. In addition, I collaborated on projects investigating mobile notification management techniques and cross-device notification interactions. These efforts resulted in several publications at prestigious conferences like [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi) and [UbiComp](https://dl.acm.org/conference/ubicomp).
